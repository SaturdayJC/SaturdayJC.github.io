Think a pub, where you would sit down with your friends at the end of a week, sip beer — nothing but Guinness for me, thank you — and talk about a paper(s) that sparked your imagination. A concoction of squigly notes, discheveled drawings and diagrams, and barely formed new ideas.

  <span class="first-letter">S</span>cience; it provides a window to understand the natural world. For the child inside us, it evokes emotions. Like our grandparents, it sits us next to a bonfire on a particularly cold winter night, and tells us (accurate) stories how the world came to be. We get to wonder how our universe was formed and how of the many planets, only this pale blue planet would go on to support life. Science gives us a glimpse into the world 2.7–3.5 billion years ago, when life started. It gives us the power to imagine how the landscape would have looked like back then, or imagine our ancestor who got off the tree branches in Africa about 3.2 million years ago and started walking for the first time. How would that individual have felt? Was it similar to how we feel when we learn to bicycle or skateboard for the first time? Did we take to walking like a child takes skating? How did that and the other changes in our lifestyle change our constitution? And so continues the questions that fill our minds. Empirical and rational understandings of this world through a scientific lens fuels such imagination.

  I don’t know what the artist was trying to portray, but to me it  summarises what a scientist will do in his life.
